# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Pyber Analysis 

### The purpose of this analysis was to help Omar and V.lsualize understand the ride sharing data by different city types. The city types were broken down into three separate categories: urban, suburban, and rural. We were to create a line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Pyber Results

### The urban cities had a much higher total fare rate when compared to the other two. While the rural average fare price was higher than both the urban and suburban cities. Drivers make much more money doing rural trips but they don’t see as many rides when compared to the other two. Come march there is a spike in the number of rides in urban cites, and the rural cities stay consistently low all year round. 

## Pyber Summary 

### When analyzing the data, you can see that the ride sharing is much more lucrative in the urban cites. This would be due to the number of people in the cites so therefore they are getting more rides. Also, a lot of people don’t have vehicles with living in a big metro city so that means they are using ride-sharing more often. The spike in March for the urban cites could be since winter is over therefore people are out and about more. The rural areas stay consistently low because it cost more to get a ride into a bigger city, also there might not be as many drivers going to those areas.
